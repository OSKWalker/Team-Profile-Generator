# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator Homework Assignment

# Grading Requirement

Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot(s), and link to video demonstrating the application functionality.

# Project Description

The objective of this exercise is to create a command-line application using Node.js that takes in information (utilizing the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) about employees on a software engineering team, then dynamically generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Due to testing being essential to the maintainability of the code, unit tests will also be provided for each module. Each module is checked (utilizing [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest))to ensure that it passes its requisite test.

The application is executed with the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Tests are executed with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Upon invocation, the user should experience the following:

> > - a series of prompts concerning information for the application repository including: the application title, a project description, table of contents, installation, usage, licensing, instructions for contributions, testing, and where to direct questions and concerns about the repo.
>
> > - the project title displayed as the title of the README.
>
> > - information entered for the description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions should be added to their requisite titled sections.
>
> > - the chosen license should appear near the top of the readme with a notice in the section titled "License" explaining the coverage.
>
> > - the "Questions" section populated with the user's GitHub username and email address for contact with additional questions.
>
> > - the ability to navigate to the corresponding sections of the README by clicking on the links in the Table of Contents.
